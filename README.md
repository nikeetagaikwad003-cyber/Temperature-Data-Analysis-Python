# Temperature Data Analysis & Outlier Treatment using Python

##  Project Overview
This project analyzes daily temperature data to identify patterns, detect anomalies, and treat outliers using statistical methods. Outlier treatment is essential to ensure data quality and improve the accuracy of analysis and forecasting.

The project demonstrates data cleaning, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and statistical techniques using Python.
